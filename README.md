# UnnamedProject

UnnamedProject is a simple hex-based game.

It is based on the three following themes chosen randomly: "Growing Things", "Time Loop" and "Dying Planet".

## Getting Started

To launch using eclipse, first add all jars in  "UnnamedProject/lib" in the Java Build Path Libraries. You also have to add the argument "-Djava.library.path=lib/natives" to the run configuration.
